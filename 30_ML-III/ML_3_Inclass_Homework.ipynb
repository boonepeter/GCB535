    "Now that we have this capability and we've seen some of the dangers, we're going to spend this week on a game. In this game, we have two goals: **1) We want to build the best predictor that we can**, but **2)at all times we want to have an accurate idea of how well the predictor works**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this game, we've managed to get our hands on some data about two diseases (D1 and D2). Each of these datasets has features in columns and examples in rows. Each feature represents a clinical measurement, while each row represents a person. We want to be able to predict whether or not a person has a disease (the last column).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll supply you with four datasets for each disease throughout the week. For the first day, we've given you two of them. We also provide example code to read the data. From there, the path that you take is up to you. **We do not know the best predictor or even what the maximum achievable accuracy for these data!** This is a chance to experiment and find out what best captures disease status.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning algorithm, SVM, that we've already introduced has many things that you can change. You've already played around with changes to the C parameter. You could change other options as well. You may want to try to play around with different \"kernel\" parameters, \"C\" parameters, even the underlying algorithm!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel like trying entirely different algorithms, a few potential ones are demonstrated in scikit-learn's documentation: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interests of recording your research steps, whatever you change should be recorded and noted in the iPython notebook. We provide an example first move below. In every case, please label the move number, the goal (what you hope to implement), the rationale (why you've chosen to implement that, or make that move as a result of the prior move), and an expected accuracy which you fill out after you build and run your code."
