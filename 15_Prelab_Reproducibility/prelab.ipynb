    "One important idea in reproducible computational research is to use **literate programming** with a **markdown** file. Don't be intimidated by these terms if you never heard them before. Simply put, literate programming is putting your code with your results and annotations together in just one file. In R, you can generate this type of file with RMarkdown (or knitr) package. In Python, you can do it with IPython Notebook. Most of the course documents for this course are written in IPython Nootbook. In this lecture, we will show you how to generate this type of file in R.
