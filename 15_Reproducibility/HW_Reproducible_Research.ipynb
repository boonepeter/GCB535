T-test or Wilcoxon rank test? Why? If you do not know the different, you can go back to the statistics lecture, or use google. Hint: What does the t-test assume?\n",

For example, you can compare the expression of geneA vs. geneB to see if they are significantly different. Make sure to use approprite statistical test especially when the expression values are not normally distributed.
