## Course description

This course provides broad overview of bioinformatics and computational biology
as applied to biomedical research. A primary objective of the course is to
enable students to integrate modern bioinformatics tools into their research
activities. Course material is aimed to address biological questions using
computational approaches and the analysis of data.

A basic primer in programming and operating in a UNIX environment will be
presented, and students will also be introduced to Python, R, and tools for
reproducible research. This course emphasizes direct, hands-on experience with
applications to current biological research problems. The course is **NOT
INTENDED** for computer science students who want to learn about biologically
motivated algorithmic problems; GCB/CIS/BIOL536 and GCB537 is more appropriate.

Areas include DNA sequence alignment, genetic variation and analysis, motif
discovery, study design for high-throughput sequencing, RNA and gene expression,
single gene and whole-genome analysis, machine learning, and topics in systems
biology. The relevant principles underlying methods used for analysis in these
areas will be introduced and discussed at a level appropriate for biologists
without a background in computer science.

The course will assume a solid knowledge of modern biology. An advanced
undergraduate course such as BIOL421 or a graduate course in biology such as
BIOL526 (Experimental Principles in Cell and Molecular Biology), BIOL527
(Advanced Molecular Biology and Genetics), BIOL528 (Advanced Molecular
Genetics), BIOL540 (Genetic Systems), or equivalent, is a prerequisite.

## Equipment prerequisite

All students are required to bring a laptop to class for in class activities.
TAs will provide help with the material, but students should be computer-capable
with their own laptop, and should be willing/capable to download and install
free software from the Internet.

## Grading

### Composition of grades

Grades are composed of:

* the course project (50% total, 25% written proposal,
25% oral presentation)
* homework assignments (30%)
* in-class labs assignments (10%)
* class participation (10%).

For the homework grade, we will drop scores from the 3 lowest scoring
assignments when determining the final grade.

### Late grading policy:

For in-class lab assignments, we will not accept late turn-ins. For homework, we
will grade assignments turned in after the due date up to one week past the
deadline, but grades will be penalized (minus 30% off). Our late policy is
driven by fairness, because answer keys will be handed out a week after problems
are due.

## Plagiarism policy

Consistent with the University of Pennsylvania's honor code and policies on
academic integrity, we maintain a zero-tolerance policy on plagiarism. For
assignments containing text that the instructors determine is plagiarized,
students will receive a grade of zero for the assignment and the case will be
referred to the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary measures. Students
may not always be aware of what constitutes plagiarism in their work. If you are
unsure, please contact one of the course directors. Please see links below
regarding the office of academic integrity for Penn’s policy on plagiarism and
our discretion on grading.

## Reference Texts

As this is a rapidly moving field, there is no textbook required for this course. We rely on a combination of online material and active exercises. There are a number of existing resources that may be valuable during this course.

1. See [PLOS Computational Biology
Collections](http://www.ploscollections.org/static/pcbiCollections),
specifically sections on Education, Developing Computational Biology, and
Translational Bioinformatics:
2. Bioinformatics for Biologists, eds. Pavel Pevzner and Ron Shamir, Cambridge University Press, 2011.
3. Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics by Jonathan Pevsner (www.bioinfbook.org/). This compiles material used for a course at Johns Hopkins.
