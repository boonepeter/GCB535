# GCB535
This repository contains the course materials for GCB 535 taught at the University of Pennsylvania.

## Sage Math Cloud
Computing needs for the course were handled via SageMathCloud. We used a medium course plan, and requested disk space upgrades to support the hard drive space required for the class.

## Setup
Some exercises require setup. For example, code to simulate data used in the k-means clustering exercise (26_Machine_Learning_I_assignment/kmeans-population.csv). Code to generate such files will be found in folders prefixed with the word "SETUP".
