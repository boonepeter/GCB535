Before doing the T-test, it is important to know that T-test has an assumpution: the data must follow a normal distribution. Otherwise, the T-test is not valid. The simple way to check if the data is normally distributed or not is to plot them. We will learn how to plot in R in the next lecture. For now, let's assume the data are normally distributed and it is safe to use  the t-test on them."
